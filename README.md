This is a repository for my senior capstone project N-Body Codes. 
> Abstract: The orbiting of a supermassive black hole binary system is a massively energetic phenomena that can have significant dynamical effects within active galactic nuclei (AGN). Eventually it is possible that these two supermassive black holes (SMBH) spiral into each other and collide, thus coalescing into a single larger SMBH. As a result of this collision and the emission of gravitational waves from the orbiting bodies, it is possible for the merged black hole to receive a “kick” velocity of up to several 1000 km/s and eject it from the center of its host galaxy. As the black hole leaves the AGN it drags some of the mass with it which changes the broad emission line signatures we would normally expect to receive from an AGN and allows us to detect the recoiling SMBH. In this project I will use an N-Body code to simulate the effect of the SMBH recoil on its surrounding galaxy. The simulation output will then make it possible to calculate the emission line profiles. Further analysis of these profiles will then help to identify characteristics of these recoil kicks and help guide the search for possible future candidates in spectroscopic databases. 

This code is based on the N-Body integrator code Rebound https://github.com/hannorein/rebound

## Part 1: AGN-Body Code
This code is used to simulate the broad line region surrounding the SMBH and what happens when the central mass recieves a kick velocity. 

## Part 2: Data Extraction and Analysis
WIP

## Part 3: Identify Trends in Profile Properties
